Prerequisit of Globbing and Export Statement 

-> We are creating files which starts from a to z.
	:=touch {a..z}.sh
	:=touch {a..z}.txt

-> if you want to experiment with two characters files then run below command. (here file will create with first character with capital ALPHABET letter)
	:=for i in {A..Z}; do for j in {a..z}; do  touch "$i$j.sh"; done; done
	:==for i in {A..Z}; do for j in {a..z}; do  touch "$i$j.txt"; done; done
-> now we need a files which contains more than one character so here i am creating a files like aaa,aab,....,zzz
	:=for i in {a..z}; do for j in {a..z}; do for k in {a..z}; do touch "$i$j$k.sh"; done; done; done
