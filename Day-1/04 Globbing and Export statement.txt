# Globbing and Export statement

1. what are the standard wildcard characters ?
:- *,?

2. what do export command do in bash?
:- it will export a variable or a function to environment of all child processes.


Prerequisit of Globbing and Export Statement (Run all prerequisit commands in killercoda or where are you performing tickets but make sure you run all the commands before go to tickets) 

-> We are creating files which starts from a to z.
	:=touch {a..z}.sh
	:=touch {a..z}.txt

-> if you want to experiment with two characters files then run below command. (here file will create with first character with capital ALPHABET letter)
	:=for i in {A..Z}; do for j in {a..z}; do  touch "$i$j.sh"; done; done
	:==for i in {A..Z}; do for j in {a..z}; do  touch "$i$j.txt"; done; done
-> now we need a files which contains more than one character so here i am creating a files like aaa,aab,....,zzz
	:=for i in {a..z}; do for j in {a..z}; do for k in {a..z}; do touch "$i$j$k.sh"; done; done; done


Once the environments is ready. so let's starts with ticket.

Ticket 4.1: list all the files having .sh as a extension.
Ticket 4.2: list all the files having .txt as a extension.
